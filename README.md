\newline FLDCRF [1] is a single and multi-label generalization of LDCRF [2]. In our single-label experiments on 4 datasets (NTU [1], UCI opportunity [3], UCI gesture phase [4], JAAD [5]) across 6 experiments, FLDCRF improves over LDCRF performance and outperforms LSTM and LSTM-CRF on all test sets. All datasets are small/medium sized with < 40,000 instances.
