The 'outer' folder contains tabulated features and labels during our nested CV experiment on UCI gesture phase dataset [1]. 

Each file contains a test data (outer loop) and a training data (which were considered for cross-validation for model selection as inner loops). We have 7 outer loop files, each containing one of the sequences as test and remaining 6 necessary for 6 fold cross-validation on the inner loops. All in all, there are 7 outer folds and 6 inner fold for each outer fold.
